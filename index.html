      Enjoy this show of my past/current projects!

        <h2>C1C0 Scheduler (Reimplimentation)</h2>
        <div>
          <p>
            This project has been the result of me taking an implementation of the scheduler for a lab assistant robot, named C1C0
            and going about reimplementing it for the sake of greater extensibility (removing many hardcoded components, while adding
            many utiltiies to allow other developers to more easily plug into it) and potentially speeding up the project along the way.
            This has lead me to creating a robot scheduling system that is modular enough to potentially be used on other robotic chassis with
            significantly less setup required than having to write a scheduler from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            Features include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Sensor Suite with automatic worker thread spawning to collect Serial data with the possibility of creating custom
              "data collection" classes that can be used to collect other kinds of data.</li>
            <li>Reader Writer Suite that can be used to easily utilize reader-writer locks in above data reading situations.</li>
            <li>Automatic support for over the web interfacing (thanks to using gRPC).</li>
            <li>Extensible functionality- as simple as implementing a function that takes a predefined set of arguments and adding
              said function to a list in the System-implementing class.</li>
            <li>And more, see the `packaging` branch on Github.</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>TCAT Data Pipline/ Warehouse</h2>
        <p>
          This has been a massive data analysis project taken on while I was a "Programmer Intern" for Tompkins Consolidated Area Transit (TCAT).
          The work I did here involved building a pipeline that would pull large amounts of data, and automatically both statistically and heuristically
          analyze the data. This project eventually led to me and my supervisor to begin constructing a new data warehouse- which turned out to be
          what we needed all along as new and new regular analysis were needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a result, this project is still on-going, but projected to be completed by this January, 2022.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is also a possibility of this project going open-source. As of right now, however, it is closed-source.

        <h2>Project H-API (indefinitely on hiatus)</h2>
        <p>
          This was a long-time pet-project of mine that I started before a few years before entering university and had worked 
          on-and-off during my first two years. It's objective was to simulate -not emulate- the human mind using modern psychological
          models as a base abstraction for how the mind works. This is obviously less computationally intensive than emulating a human brain,
          and had found some limited success. During my time at university, I had found that many of my self-research had proven to be correct
          (including the chosen model for personality and to some limited degree my approach to how it affects emotions) while finding other
          models could use improvements (such as my treatment of the way personality changes and lack of modeling temperment).
        </p>
        <p>
          Flash forward to today, and I view this project as a learning experience where I see that I had made lots of really cool meaningful
          progress, while also realizing where I was wrong and what approaches could use improvement. I believe that this is a project that I
          can one day revisit and give another try, and who knows, I may be successful.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Project H-API stands for Project Human - Application Programming Interface
          I am indeed quite proud of the wordplay :)
