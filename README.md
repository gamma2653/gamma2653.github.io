# Christopher De Jesus - Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website showcasing my work at the intersection of technology, psychology, and creative problem-solving.

## About This Portfolio

I'm Christopher De Jesus, a Cornell University graduate with a background in Psychology and Computer Science. My work explores how information is processed—both in human minds and in machines. I'm fascinated by computational psychology and the parallels between human cognition and artificial intelligence.

## What You'll Find Here

### Home

The landing page introduces my philosophy: understanding how we process information, perceive the present moment, and learn to live more fully. You'll find links to explore my three main areas of work.
